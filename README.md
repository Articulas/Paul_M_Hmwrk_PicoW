# Paul_M_Hmwrk_PicoW

These are the Pico/Micro Python homwork projects related to Paul McWhorter's YouTube lessons. He has us make a video of the code and electronics in operation along with the code. It gets his video students to interact and help each other. It is fun. He is a very good teacher!!!!!!
